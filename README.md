# 04-Challenge
Here I built a coding knowledge quiz. This quiz which loads into the browser helps users to develop their skills specifically relating to JavaScript. By answering the questions wrong they are given a penalty of 5 less seconds and the original countdown time is 60 seconds to finish all of the questions that are in this 5 question quiz.

Under the assets I've provided a screenshot of the quiz once it is completed and it allows you a space where you can leave your initials. The link for the deployed website will be right here.
